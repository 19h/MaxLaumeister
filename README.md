# Hello!

**If youâ€™re a potential employer** wondering what makes me stand out, please read [the about section of my website](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/about/)! It talks about where my software has been linked, mentioned, and cited (NPR, Wikimedia Foundation Blog, Hackaday, etc.), my sucessful SaaS business, etc.

**Regarding my software:** My GitHub has my most popular open-source projects, but it only tells part of the story! To see *all* of my sofware, nicely categorized and described, see [the software section of my website](https://www.maxlaumeister.com/software/).
